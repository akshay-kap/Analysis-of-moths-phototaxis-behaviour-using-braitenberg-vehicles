# Analysis-of-moth's-phototaxis-behaviour-using-braitenberg-vehicles
- This project is carried out to observe emergent behavior of braitenberg vehicles mimicking moth's photo taxis behavior.
- The simulations were carried out in webot using kapera's robot (II)
- The controllers were written in python, the __controller folder__ features python files specific to given experiments(also text file featuring the trajectories are recorede in controllers folder)
  - The experiments focused on imitating "love" behaviour towards light as described by Baritenberg vehicles.
  - Data analysis by varying light intensivity, attraction coefficient towards light source, and repulsion coefficient among multiple agents is been done in python.
  - SVR and Linear regression models were used to comment on non-linear emergent behavior of the  multiple agents mimicing moth's phototaxis nature.
